### Selenium:
Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.


## Installation :

You must install selenium and chromium web browser driver. The steps for download and installation can be found from [here]

The script can be run using command :

``` sh
python polisis_automation.py
```

The output csv file will be saved in the current directory named 'polisis_output.csv'.
